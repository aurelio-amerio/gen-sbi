Diffusion Models in GenSBI
-------------------------

This package provides tools and modules for working with diffusion-based generative models, including training, sampling, and evaluation routines. The implementation is inspired by and builds upon the foundational work of Karras et al. and the official EDM library:

- T. Karras et al. "Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models." [arXiv:2206.00364](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364)
- [NVlabs/edm](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm)

Key features:
- Score-based generative modeling using stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
- EDM (Elucidating Diffusion Models) training and sampling
- Modular solvers and schedulers for flexible experimentation

# If you use this package, please consider citing the EDM paper and library.
