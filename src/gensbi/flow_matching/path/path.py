class ProbPath(ABC):
    r"""
    Abstract class, representing a probability path.

    A probability path transforms the distribution :math:`p(X_0)` into :math:`p(X_1)` over :math:`t=0\rightarrow 1`.

    The ``ProbPath`` class is designed to support model training in the flow matching framework. It supports two key functionalities: (1) sampling the conditional probability path and (2) conversion between various training objectives.
    Here is a high-level example

    .. code-block:: python

        # Instantiate a probability path
        my_path = ProbPath(...)

        # Sets t to a random value in [0,1]
        key = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)
        t = jax.random.uniform(key)

        # Samples the conditional path X_t ~ p_t(X_t|X_0,X_1)
        path_sample = my_path.sample(x_0=x_0, x_1=x_1, t=t)
    """

        Sample from an abstract probability path.
