Flow Matching Models in GenSBI
-----------------------------

This package provides tools and modules for flow matching generative models, including path construction, solvers, and loss functions. The implementation is a derivative work of the Facebook Research Flow Matching library and is inspired by the foundational work of Lipman et al.:

- Y. Lipman et al. "Flow Matching for Generative Modeling." [arXiv:2210.02747](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02747)
- Y. Lipman et al. "Flow Matching Guide and Code." [arXiv:2412.06264](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06264)
