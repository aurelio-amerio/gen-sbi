        ContinuousFMLoss is a class that computes the continuous flow matching loss.

        Args:
            path (MixtureDiscreteProbPath): Probability path (x-prediction training).
            reduction (str, optional): Specify the reduction to apply to the output ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction is applied to the output, ``'mean'``: the output is reduced by mean over sequence elements, ``'sum'``: the output is reduced by sum over sequence elements. Defaults to 'mean'.
