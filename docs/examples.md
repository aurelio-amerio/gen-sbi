# Examples


This page provides links and descriptions for example notebooks and scripts demonstrating the use of GenSBI. For more details, see the [GenSBI-examples repository](https://github.com/aurelio-amerio/GenSBI-examples).


## Unconditional density estimation
This example demonstrates how to use density estimation techniques in a 2D space. 
Includes training and evaluation of flow matching and diffusion models.

## Posterior density estimation: SBI Benchmarks
This series of examples demostrate how to use GenSBI for posterior density estimation on a series of SBI benchmarks.
We adopt either the Flux1 or Simformer models for this task.
