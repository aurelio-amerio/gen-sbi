## Work in progress!
GenSBI is a work in progress, and we are actively developing new features and improvements. Expect the API and examples to evolve over time. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community!

## Getting Started

To get started with GenSBI, install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aurelio-amerio/GenSBI.git[cuda12]
```

We advise to take a look at the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) page for additional installation instructions and basic usage. 

You can also explore the [Examples](examples.md) page for practical demonstrations of GenSBI's capabilities.

You can find the API documentation in the [API Documentation](api/gensbi/index.md) section.
